"""R5.1: EXPLAIN ANALYZE physical path trace (architecture review R5).

Covers, against the installed release wheel:
1. ``Actual Path:`` appears in EXPLAIN ANALYZE output and in no other plan.
2. Metadata COUNT(*), generic scan, and O(1) ``_id`` point-lookup routes.
3. The batched scan pipeline route reports the batch count on a
   multi-row-group table (200k narrow rows span two adaptive row groups).
4. Shapes outside every fast path report the generic executor route.
